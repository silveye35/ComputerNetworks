1. Edgar Silveyra and Daniel Wilson

2. There are no known issues with the program.

3. We tested the program by executing it in four setups. 
	-Daniel as clients, Edgar as server
	-Edgar as clients, Daniel as server
	-Daniel as clients and server
	-Edgar as clients and server
In each of these configurations, we tested connection, gameplay, and timeout functionality. The program functioned correctly in all these cases.

4.The most challenging aspect of this project was correctly implementing the timeout. We realized after implementing a simple timeout that the client would still send the user's guess, resulting in bugs. We were able to implement a non-blocking recieve call for client to check if the timeout has already occured. This fixed our issues and allowed our code to run without errors.
